This is more or less my inaugural post. Brought upon by my somewhat recent change in working situation that has prompted my desire to keep a blog in the first place.

I have never had a job where I can only speak positive things about. Alike other amazing companies such as [Github](http://github.com/ "Github"), we enjoy things that traditional software companies have never heard of, things such as a [0% turnover rate](https://twitter.com/holman/status/303576839132164097 'Zach Holman tweet stating no one has ever quit from Github').

Here are the main points that I usually talk about when I tell people about my awesome job.

### Lack of commute

This is a big deal for those of us living sunny California. So it turns out that, while California does indeed have amazing weather, it isn't a very well kept secret. With over [38 million people](https://www.google.com/publicdata/explore?ds=kf7tgg1uo9ude_&met_y=population&idim=state:06000&dl=en&hl=en&q=california%20population) and over [31 million cars](http://www.dmv.ca.gov/about/profile/est_fees_pd_by_county.pdf) on the road. We have some of the worst traffic problems in the country. With traffic I was spending just about 2 hours a day on the road. Just so you don't have to bust open Calculator.app or calc.exe, that's roughly 8.3% of my day. Want a surefire way to extend your lifespan without eating like a rabbit and living like a monk? Work remote.

### Getting actual shit done

Anyone who's worked in an office environment knows that the biggest detriment to productivity is context switching. I can get to your code review in 2 hours, or I can get to it in 6 hours with you constantly tapping my shoulder to remind me, and not even get what I'm doing done. This is a no brainer.

### Control

Never will you have to complain that your workplace is too noisy/quiet/bright/dark/not-at-a-strip-club. You have absolute control over this workplace. If something about it doesn't work for you, make it work for you.

### Flexibility

Since we go out of our way to make sure every scheduled meeting (Usually a voice call over [Skype](http://skype.com)) is producitive and positively enhances our working day, your work day becomes very flexible. On the Uberman Polyphasic Sleep Schedule? Better hope you have remote job. Sometimes I feel like remote work is just a piece of unspoken common knowledge, who else has the time to go to the post office at 11am on a weekday?

## Needless to say, not for everyone

There are definitely reasons for which why one cannot enjoy all or if any of the benefits of remote working. Things like if your line of work is in or interfaces with a traditional industry such as finance. But the whole point is that you should be thinking about your conditions of work and not simply accepting that this is how it is. Software traditionally has been code monkies locked in a tall IBM building typing away. But today, we are a team of 5  (at the time of writing) hackers building a great product.

### I am more productive in an office environment where I am pressured

If you are only motivated by the presence of peer pressure, then it is possible that this line of work may not be the best choice for you anyway

### There is less of a feeling of comradery

Staying communicated and connected seldomly has anything to do physical distance. Even at an office, some of the people I was most connected with were the ones that sat across the entire building, and never talked to the guy who sat behind me. Guess through which medium? That's right, company chat. You'll stay connected to the ones that you want and make an effort to connect to, physically close or not.

### I'm afraid!!

This isn't a blog article to try and convince everyone that remote working is the holy grail to working productivity and building great products, but it's the whole idea that our working situations, like our product, should be an ever-evolving thing. Even if you're a banker, waiter, fortune 500 CEO, you should still be thinking about what you can do to maximize what you have and trying to get more out of our short stay on this planet.
